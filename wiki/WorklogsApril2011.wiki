  * Technical Time (Maurizio Baffico, Ruben Soto)
  * General Overview of the ESO50cm control software/hardware by Maurizio. 
     * Startup procedure reviewed
     * Identification of critical processes.
     * Detection and analysis of common failures.
  * Analysis for the replacement of SCB by a PC with serial connection. In principle this option is not feasible since it required modifications to the electronic boards (PIC) which read the telescope position.
  * Creation of tcs and tcsmgr accounts on operator console. 
  * Start implementation of ESO50cmStartup script which allows to start the system from the operator console without intervention at SBC computer. This script also consider the implementation of a monitoring process which will stop the telescope is a risk position is reached.
