= 2011-04-05 = 
  * Technical Time (Maurizio Baffico, Ruben Soto)
  * General Overview of the ESO50cm control software/hardware by Maurizio. 
     * Startup procedure reviewed
     * Identification of critical processes.
     * Detection and analysis of common failures.
  * Analysis for the replacement of SCB by a PC with serial connection. In principle this option is not feasible since it required modifications to the electronic boards (PIC) which read the telescope position.
  * Creation of tcs and tcsmgr accounts on operator console. 
  * Start implementation of ESO50cmStartup script which allows to start the system from the operator console without intervention at SBC computer. This script also consider the implementation of a monitoring process which will stop the telescope is a risk position is reached.

= 2011-04-12 = 
  * Technical Time (Maurizio Baffico, Tzu-Chiang Shen, Pedro Escarate)
  * Upgrade the O.S. of the TS-7800 Single Board Computer
    * Preparing SD card with newer version of Debian operative system 
    * The current on is Debian GNU/Linux 3.1, which is from 2006
    * We need at least version 5 (lenny) from 2010. This requirement is to install ICE framework 
    * The internet speed was slow and unstable, we decided that Maurizio will create the SD card at San Joaquin tomorrow
  * I showed Maurizio and Pedro the purpose of ICE, and we discussed about how to proceed with the refactoring
    * A virtual machine with ubuntu was prepared. Inside of it a ARM emulator is running (to emulate the TS7800)
    * The ARM emulator has Debian 5.0 and ICE-E 1.2 installed.
    * A demo with fake process TCS was created, and another client (process in another machine) could invoke a method in the server
    * A new class Tcs will be created and will be the facade which will cover the current telescope61 and lcu's functionalities
    * A new Tcs class will be object oriented with c++
