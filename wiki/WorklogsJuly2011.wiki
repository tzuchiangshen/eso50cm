  * Reviewed parkTelescope code and algorithm 
  * Found conflict between current setConfiguration behavior and the new version
  * Helped Pedro to set up his development environment 
  * Troubleshoot telescope setTarget problem. For some reason using the current code, the telescope couldn't be moved to encoder position 511 in Dec

  * Technical Time (Maurizio Baffico, Perdro Escarate, Johnny Reveco, Ruben Soto)
  * Investigating problem to run LCUControl and old control software simultaneously. It works properly for getEnconder commands however there are some concurrence problems with getPosition commands. 
  * Power cut affected observatory.

  * code revision 178
  * Technical Time (Perdro Escarate, Tzu-Chiang Shen, Ruben Soto: Remotely)
  * Fix AZ/ALT formatting at qtcli
  * Rebuild the $SWROOT 
  * Tracking testing: 
    * SetTracking works but RA axis dritfs (with velocity=602)
    * add verbose info to make sure that the tracking velocity reaches to the LCU correctly.
    * Fix setTracking method in tcs/src/Client-lcu.py
  * SetTarget tests:
    * pointed the telescope to 5 different sources. The telescope move properly to the target position. But we had to invoke moveToTarget() twice in order to reach a <10 seconds of differences. This symptom has already reported by M. Baffico. And the current sofware has the same problem.
  * park telescope test:
    * the telescope parked at
