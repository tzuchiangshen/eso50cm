  * Reviewed current control system code sent by Maurizio Baffico

  * Technical time: (Tzu Shen, Maurizio Baffic)
  * Current code were reviewed, and several details about the control system were discussed. 
  * Current network layout was reviewed and a drawing will be provided soon by Tzu
  * We agreed to reorganized the current code into module based approach. 
  * The deployment also will be modified to have a standard structure, similar to the INTROOT in VLT and ACS software. Two accounts are suggested, tcs and tcsmgr, the first one will be use to operate the telescope and will have read-only access to the INTROOT and the second one will be dedicated to install/deploy new software (rw access).
  * Maurizio also showed the encoder system of the telescope.

  * Technical time: (Maurizio Baffico, Johnny Reveco)
  * Maurizio gave me a very clarifying overview of the system
  * At LCU:
    * Maurizio modified /etc/init.d/eso50cm to mount the HDD connected to the LCU on /mnt/hdd during the startup
    * Created accounts tcs (Telescope Software Operator) and tcsmgr (Telescope Software Manager). Added tcs to the tcsmgr group. The account home directories were located at /mnt/hdd/home2/tcs and tcsmgr.
    * Created directory structure and environmental variable structure according to the documented in
