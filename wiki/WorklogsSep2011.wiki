  * Technical Time (Perdro Escarate, Johnny Reveco, Tzu-Chiang Shen)
  * svn version r203
  * logging service 
    * first attempt to use logging service. The ObservingImpl.cpp was adapted to use the logging service instead of printf. The log messages arrived to the logPanel successfully. But the log level is incorrect. The bug was corrected but not tested yet.
    * logPanel GUI adjusted to fit the console resolution
    * Modified Logger configuration files to be shared with other IceBox application (moved to general configurations directory)
    * Fixed bug in the Logger module that prevent the logger to sent logs from the LCU to the console
    * Fixed bug in cmake configuration that prevented the compilation of the Logger module in the LCU
    * Tested the sending of log messages from the LCU to the LoggingService running at the console using a simple test script
    * Tested the filtering feature of the logPanel 

  * Pointing test
    * Managed to point the telescope to serveral sources 
    * Found Az/Alt labels were swapped in the qtcli GUI
    * Found TcsGui module doesn't compile at the console complaining about problem with wrong use of const char *. To be fix 
    *

  * Technical Time (Perdro Escarate, Tzu-Chiang Shen)
  * svn version r216
  * Startup process clean up 
    * added Deployment/ts7800/linuxrc-sdroot: fixed network configuration problem during first boot time. This will avoid the work around to created /fastboot file and reboot again. Also solved problem of permission of /dev/ttts6
    * first attempt to convert telescope61 to a service started automatically during bootime. 
      * Deployment/ts7800/etc/init.d/telescope61 created 
      * telescope61 is being launched as part of booting process but after that died. This is expected due the way a daemon should behave. Need modify telescope61 to be able to fork itself as describe at [http://www.netzmafia.de/skripten/unix/linux-daemon-howto.html] 
      * Same script is created for LCUControl
  * Logging services 
    * Adapted Observing module to use logging services intead of printf
    * Adapted a logPanel and Logger module to be independent of myslq database classes (code modification is not archived to the svn yet, to be discussed with Johnny)
  * Code clean and formatting 
    * standardize code format to use 3 space instead of tab 
    * Observing module: done 
    * tcs module: partially done. 
  * Fixed qtcli compilation problem at the console.

= 2011-09-27 = 
  * Technical Time (Perdro Escarate, Tzu-Chiang Shen, Vincent Suc, Andrea)
  * svn version r237
  * Startup process clean up 
     * Finished to convert telescope61 into a daemon. And a /etc/init.d/telescope61 initialization script was created
     * Now every time the ARM is rebooted. The telescope61 porcess is loaded automatically and ready to process request. 
  * Pointing model discussion with Vicent. 
     * Vicent show me his pointing model implmentation 
     * Vicent will send the code, and the idea is to convert it into a ICE process.
