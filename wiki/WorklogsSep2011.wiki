  * Technical Time (Perdro Escarate, Tzu-Chiang Shen)
  * svn version r216
  * Startup process clean up 
    * added Deployment/ts7800/linuxrc-sdroot: fixed network configuration problem during first boot time. This will avoid the work around to created /fastboot file and reboot again. Also solved problem of permission of /dev/ttts6
    * first attempt to convert telescope61 to a service started automatically during bootime. 
      * Deployment/ts7800/etc/init.d/telescope61 created 
      * telescope61 is being launched as part of booting process but after that died. This is expected due the way a daemon should behave. Need modify telescope61 to be able to fork itself as describe at [http://www.netzmafia.de/skripten/unix/linux-daemon-howto.html] 
      * Same script is created for LCUControl
  * Logging services 
    * Adapted Observing module to use logging services intead of printf
    * Adapted a logPanel and Logger module to be independent of myslq database classes (code modification is not archived to the svn yet, to be discussed with Johnny)
  * Code clean and formatting 
    * standardize code format to use 3 space instead of tab 
    * Observing module: done 
    * tcs module: partially done.
