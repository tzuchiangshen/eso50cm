= 2011-05-03 = 
  * Technical Time (Maurizio Baffico, Ruben Soto, Pedro Escarate)
  * Testing of basic telescope commands under ICE framework:
     * To be done remotely with the support of Pedro Escarate (Maurizio with sick leave).
     * Problems detected to boot LCU with new SD Card which contained ICE-E
     * Remote connection to LCU and Operation console not allowed due to firewall configuration problem.
     * Tests suspended due to the condition explained above and system returned to stable version.
     * Testing of ICE commands postponed until next week
= 2011-05-10 = 
  * *Technical Time (Maurizio Baffico, Tzu-Chiang Shen, Pedro Escarate)*
  * Client (ICE based) application testing
    * client application compiled at a VM with ubuntu, and configuration file was updated according to the deployment. 
    * The LCUControl application was started and communicated properly with telescope61 through shared memory
    * Found problem with values sent from LCUControl to the client application 
    * Found problem is related the different architecture between i386 and ARM (TS-7800), which is middle endian based.
  * Client Application 
    * Reviewed code in the QT client. 
    * Discussed the way TheSky6 application send commands to QT client (through rs232). 
  * Returned the system back to the stable state.

= 2011-05-24 =
  * Technical Time (Maurizio Baffico, Tzu-Chiang Shen)
  * Solved problem of data structure encoding between ARM and i386 architectures. see [http://code.google.com/p/eso50cm/wiki/BigEndianOrLittleEndian]
    * Essentially ARM use Middle Endian and i386 uses Little Endian 
    * Bytes order needs to be swapped before to be interpreted. 
    * a double in i386: ABCD EFGH, should be interpreted as EFGH ABCD in ARM
  * Discussed with Maurizio and Pedro the observing mode required for OUC. Specifically for Pucheros
