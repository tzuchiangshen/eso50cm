  * code revision 94
  * Technical Time (Maurizio Baffico, Tzu-Chiang Shen, Perdro Escarate)
  * Tested getPosition method of LCUControl. 
    * All the fields of the telescope data structure was received correctly except for localtime and lcutime. 
    * at the ARM the calculated values were 

  * CMakeList.txt 
    * remove libIceUtil in the linking of LCUControl

   * code revision 124
   * Technical Time (Johnny Reveco, Maurizio Baffico, Ruben Soto)     
   * Implementation of SWROOT area at operator console and LCU
   * Continue verification of GET commands: 
      * Fixed minor interpretation bugs at python client and AstroUtil library.
      * All GET commands verified successfully according to the values displayed by old LCU software
   * Verification of SET commands:
      * SetTracking commands worked properly, however tracking status does not reflect real value. To be investigated.
      * ParkingTelescope does not work properly since it stuck the telescope after execution. To be investigated. 
   * General environment changes:
      * Added INTROOT support
      * added IDL folder to $SWROOT and getTemplate..
      * corrected TYPE, now for WS is not set
   * Logging system test and deploy
      * created SQL tables
      * installed mysql connector (installed boost and connector compiled for the console)
      * twoway logging from LCU to Console successfully test
      * logs are correctly being archived in the DB
      * tested discard level: working as expected
      * changed log ICE method to oneway: the response was improves in more that 6 times and the reliability is good

   * code revision 156
   * Technical Time (Maurizio Baffico, Ruben Soto)
   * Meeting at San Joaquin with Leonardo Vanzi, Pedro Escarate, Maurizio Baffico and Ruben Soto about status of ESO50CM project. We agreed that first version of operational software should be ready for end of September with a backup period of two months (end of November). 
   * Continue verification of SET commands:
      * setTracking() verified and working properly.
      * parkTelescope(): algorithm seems to be OK however there are some problem with the conversion between telescope position and encoder units. Some debug information added to code but more testing time required.
      * Created Cliet-position.py script to monitor telescope position during the tracking tests.
