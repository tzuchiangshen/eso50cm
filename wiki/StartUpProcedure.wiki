= Introduction =

This document explains the current start-up procedure

= Procedure =
== Control Room ==
 * Turn on the Linux-PC. (The current *ntp-server* for the observatory).
    # Login as *operdor*
== Telescope Room ==
 * In the ESO50cm rack:
    # Turn on the Win2-PC (black on top).
    # Login into the account *eso50*.
    # Launch the _hyperterminal_ with the predefined connection to the *ESO50cm* console (phone icon with name ESO50cm on the Desktop). 
    # Turn on the telescope's TCS (turn on the TCS Power Supply using the black switch in the rear bottom left). At this time you can see the booting messages in the console (ESO50cm Hyperterminal).
    # Login as *root* (ESO50cm Hyperterminal) and execute the command 'date' to verify if the TCS has the correct time and date. If the date is wrong something is not working in the *ntp-server*,  go to *Trubleshotting* section.
    # In the Win2-PC, start a ssh connection with the TCS (double click SSH icon on the Desktop, server: 192.168.0.10, username: operador), change to dir '~/eso50cm', and execute the command './telescope61 -v -d /dev/ttts6'.
    # Repeat the above step, and run the command './lcu -v'
